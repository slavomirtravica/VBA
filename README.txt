Hello!

This is macro/Sub/soon to be function for increasing alphanumeric characters.
Alphabet goes from 0 to 9 and than A to Z - so first "letter" is 0 and last one is Z.
Capital letters stay capital (except for Z that turns into 0)

***How to use it***
You can simply take code from .txt file and paste it to your Excel.
If you have no practice in VBA or Excel here are brief instructions:
First, you need to enable developer mode.
So, Click the File tab -> Click Options -> Click Customize Ribbon -> Under Customize the Ribbon and under Main Tabs, select the Developer check box.
When you have that on, press Alt + F11 to open editor. Paste the code there.
You can choose which sub to run by pressing Alt + F8.

You can also use it in Excel attached.
Until I turn it into function you have to put your code in A2 and under. You can override code by replacing A with new input column,
B with new output and tekred variable with number of row you want to start in.
